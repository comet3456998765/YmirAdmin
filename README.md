### Newer versions
> Currently fixing bugs and tweaking commands to reduce lag

> Currently removing/adding commands, some commands removed to integrate them on previous commands

### Script or certain commands doesn't execute?
> This could be due to an error in the source, it will be fixed as soon as possible. Note that raw files will take 5 minutes to update due to Github stuff.

> The workspace file dedicated to this is outdated, go to `YourExecutorFolder/workspace`, look for a file named `YmirAdminSettings.pl`, and delete that file. Reload the script again to see if it works. Note that deleting this file will revert to default settings and remove your whitelist, etc.
